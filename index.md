  ## Continuous Integration
  Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. It involves automated builds and automated tests to ensure that the changes do not break the application.

  ## Continuous Deployment
  Continuous Deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production environments after passing through the CI pipeline. It ensures that software updates are delivered to users quickly and reliably.

  ## Monitoring and Logging
  Monitoring and Logging are crucial aspects of DevOps. They involve tracking the performance and behavior of applications and infrastructure in real-time. Logs provide valuable insights into system behavior and help diagnose issues.

  ## Alerting
  Alerting is an essential part of the monitoring process. It involves setting up notifications to alert the relevant teams or individuals when predefined thresholds or conditions are met. This allows for proactive responses to potential issues before they impact users.

  ## Infrastructure as Code
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It enables automation, consistency, and scalability in infrastructure management.

  ## AWS
  AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a compre
